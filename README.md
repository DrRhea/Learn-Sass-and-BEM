Welcome to my repository for learning Sass and BEM! This repository contains exercises, notes, and small projects that I've worked on as part of my journey to learn Sass (Sassy CSS) and the BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology, primarily following the learning resources provided by the YouTube channel Coder Coder.

## About the Learning Source

My primary learning source is the videos provided by [Coder Coder](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCoderCode) on YouTube. I highly recommend this channel for anyone looking to gain a better understanding of Sass and BEM concepts.
